Rust based address import tool.

Get address DB from:

https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-dga-19432f89-dc3a-4ef3-b943-5326ef1dbecc/details?q=

Download, Unzip and then import into a DB with:

$ ./import.sh path_to_unzipped_dir name_of_your_db

Then edit the source in src/main.rs to set your database name and the new collection.

$ cargo run

And wait for a day or so :-)

Afterwards you will have a nice new collection which has this schema:

{
  "_id": ObjectId("5e910a4100002e920022ca51"),
  "STATE": 5,
  "LOCALITY": "THORNLANDS",
  "ADDRESS_DETAIL_PID": "GAQLD719562882",
  "POSTCODE": 4164,
  "STREET": "GODFREY STREET ",
  "NUMBER_FIRST": "6",
  "LONG": 153.24276539999999613,
  "LAT": -27.553647994995117188
}

The state ids are:

1 = ACT
2 = NSW
3 = NT
4 = OT
5 = QLD
6 = SA
7 = TAS
8 = VIC
9 = WA

Rust based address import tool.

Get address DB from:

https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-dga-19432f89-dc3a-4ef3-b943-5326ef1dbecc/details?q=

Download, Unzip:

Edit the import.sh script and change "fiveEstellas" to the name of your MondoDB database,
and the path where you unzipped your downloaded data.

Then mport into a DB with:

$ ./import.sh

After this your mongo DB will have a tremendous number of collections that are used by the Rust based tool.

You will need an incredible amount of disk space. I unzipped the files onto an external drive and then used that to import from since your MongoDB will grow considerably.

Once you have it all imported into MongoDB, the Rust tool below uses the MongoDB so you don't need all the unzipped files anymore.

Now edit the source in src/main.rs to set your database name and the new collection.

$ cargo run

And wait for a day or so. On my old MacBook pro it does 250 records every second.

Afterwards you will have a nice new collection which has this schema:

{
  "_id": ObjectId("5e910adc003cbe3100233296"),
  "STATE": 5,
  "LOCALITY": "SPRING HILL",
  "ADDRESS_DETAIL_PID": "GAQLD163300318",
  "POSTCODE": 4000,
  "FLAT_TYPE": "SE",
  "LEVEL_TYPE": "L",
  "STREET": "WICKHAM TERRACE ",
  "FLAT_NUMBER": "3",
  "LEVEL_NUMBER": "4",
  "NUMBER_FIRST": "155",
  "NUMBER_LAST": "157",
  "LONG": 153.0250418800000034,
  "LAT": -27.464509963989257812
}

- There will always be a "NUMBER_FIRST" which is basically the house number.
- There will only be a "NUMBER_LAST" if the address spans a few house numbers.
- There will only be a "FLAT_TYPE" and "FLAT_NUMBER" if it is a block of flats.
- There will only be a "LEVEL_TYPE" and "LEVEL_NUMBER" if it is a block of flats that has multiple levels.
- The "ADDRESS_DETAIL_PID" is useful if you want something else later on from the G-NAF database.

The state ids are:

1 = ACT
2 = NSW
3 = NT
4 = OT
5 = QLD
6 = SA
7 = TAS
8 = VIC
9 = WA
